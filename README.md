# The-7-Tasks
7 GUI challenges made in ReactJS. Each one being more complex than the previous one. You can read the challenges rules here: [Eugen Kiss - 7 GUI Tasks](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/)

Live version soon!

## First challenge: Counter (not commited yet)

The task is to build a frame containing a label with a read-only text input and a button. The input default value is "0". Each time the button gets clicked, the input value should increase by 1.

## Second challenge: Temperature converter

The idea is to model bidirectional data-flow with a user-provided value. It's no more than a farenheit-celsius converter. When the celsius input changes, the farenheit one should change too.

## Third challenge: Flight booker

The task is to build a combobox that allows you to select a flight type (one-way flight or return flight) and enter the date for it in a text input. The date must follow the format dd.mm.yyyy and the return date input should only be available if the flight type is a return flight.

## Fourth challenge: Timer (soon)
